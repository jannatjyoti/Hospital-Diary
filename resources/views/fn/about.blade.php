                    <p class="intro-desc">This initiative will have a significant impact on society. When people take a
                        step to find out the best outcome over a website they shouldnâ€™t be gloomy. My thinking of making
                        such a website which will bring people and health administration closer even before. So, the
                        intuition if you see is to find a bonding between people who wants to get better service and the
                        hospital who provide services will wide. My website will have no negative consequences for the
                        environment
